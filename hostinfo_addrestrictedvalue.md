# hostinfo\_addrestrictedvalue #

Add a new possible value to the key in the hostinfo database that has restricted values
```
 % hostinfo_addrestrictedvalue key=value
```

  * This doesn't add the value to any host, it just allows hosts to have keys with this value set.
  * You should try to avoid having spaces in values as the make using hostinfo from the command line more difficult.
  * Everything will get converted to lowercase.
  * If you need to add a new key then look at [hostinfo\_addkey](hostinfo_addkey.md); use the _--restricted_ option to make the key a restricted value key
