# Generic Details #
Almost all classes have some shared attributes:
  * origin - a string representing the origin of the data, generally the user who made the change
  * createdate - when the data was created for the first time. Automatically populated by Django
  * modifieddate - when the data was last modified. Automatically populated by Django
  * audit - audit information
  * docpage - a link to documentation about this item; currently unused

All tables/models have an implicit **id** field which is the primary key for the table. Foreign Key relationships are tied to this id. This also means that if you change the name of a host it is only changing the name associated with an id, not creating a new host instance with a new name.

# Host #
This a base class storing core details about the host of which there is only really the hostname. Everything else is in other models and linked to this one.

## Attributes ##
  * hostname - the name of the host

# HostAlias #
Any host can have multiple aliases. An alias can only point to a single host. Any reference to an alias should be the same as if you referred to the real name itself.

## Attributes ##
  * hostid - Foreign Key to Host
  * alias - The alias itself

# AllowedKey #
This is where the definitions of the different keys are kept
## Attributes ##
  * key - the name of the key
  * validtype - what the contents of the value should be interpreted as
    * single
    * list
    * date
  * desc - a short description of the meaning of the key
  * restricted - a boolean indicating that this key can only take on specific values
  * readonly - a boolean indicating that this key is read-only be agreement - it just means you have to say please when changing it. This is 'enforced' only at the user interface layer.

# KeyValue #
This is the table where the values that make up hostinfo are stored.
## Attributes ##
  * hostid - Foreign Key to Host
  * keyid - Foreign Key to AllowedKey
  * value - the value

# UndoLog #
The undo log is a list of commands required to reverse actions. It is accessed by the user with [hostinfo\_undolog](hostinfo_undolog.md)

## Attributes ##
  * user - Who made the change
  * actiondate - When did they make they change
  * action - What action is required to undo their change

# RestrictedValue #
this is where the list of acceptable values are kept for the keys that have a restricted list of values.

## Attributes ##
  * keyid - Foreign Key to AllowedKey
  * value - An acceptable value for that key

# Links #
Links are URLs that are related to the host. A host can have many links, but only one of each tag. A tag is something like 'System Handbook', 'Backups' or 'Monitoring'
## Attributes ##
  * hostid - Foreign Key to Host
  * url - The URL
  * tag - The type of link
