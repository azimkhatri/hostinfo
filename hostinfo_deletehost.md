# hostinfo\_deletehost #

Delete a host from the hostinfo database
```
 % hostinfo_deletehost [--lethal] <host>
```

  * This will remove a single host (deliberately not multiple hosts) and all of its associated data
  * It will also delete all of the aliases that point to this host
  * The deletion will only occur if the _--lethal_ flag is specified, otherwise it will just tell you what it is going to do
  * There is no coming back from this - so be careful
