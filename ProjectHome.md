# Overview #

Hostinfo is a host catalog or configuration management database (CMDB) allowing storage of details about hosts and other managed elements in format that is easy to access by both humans and scripts.

There are three main interfaces to hostinfo:
  * [Wiki](WikiLinks.md) (read-only)
  * Shell command line - see below (read-write)
  * Web (read-write)

# Starting Out #
  * [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md)
  * [How to install hostinfo](Install.md)
  * [What to do after installation](GettingStarted.md)

# Concepts #
  * Details are stored in key:value pairs that are associated with hosts
    * The values of the pairs mean nothing to hostinfo itself, so you have to add the meaning in how you use hostinfo
  * Restricted Values
    * To get around the problem of hostinfo accepting anything, you can create keys that are resticted value keys.
    * These keys can only have set values - but you can add new possible values easily
  * Readonly Keys
    * If you have keys that you don't want people changing you can make them 'read-only'
    * This just means that you need to add another flag to make changes to them
  * Aliases
    * Hosts can have many names. An alias is another way of referring to the host. Anytime you refer to an alias of a host it is practically identical to referring to the host itself.

# Hostinfo commands #

There are a large number of command line utilities that are used to extract data from hostinfo as well as make changes. These are designed to be easily embedded in scripts to assist in automation.

See [Commands](Commands.md) for the full list.

# Hostinfo structure #

Everything in hostinfo is stored in a database. Each host can has zero or more key:value pairs associated with it.

There are three data types in use:

  * single values
    * This is used for things that there can be only one value per server, such as its location
  * multiple values
    * This is used for things that can have multiple values like applications installed
  * dates
    * Used for things in date format - fairly obviously.
    * Date format is YYYY-MM-DD
    * Other formats may be formatted to this format
    * 'today' and 'now' also will work and will be converted to the current day

  * Everything is stored in a string format in the database
  * Some keys have been set to be restricted which means that they can only take on certain values - and there a number of commands which set those available values.
  * Each key is set to be one of the above
