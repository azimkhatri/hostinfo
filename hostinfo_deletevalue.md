# hostinfo\_deletevalue #
Delete a value from hosts in the hostinfo database

```
 % hostinfo_deletevalue <key>[=<value>] <host> [<host>...]
```

  * Generally you don't want to delete values but rather change their contents (see [hostinfo\_replacevalue](hostinfo_replacevalue.md))
  * If you specify just a key it will remove all values associated with that key for the hosts specified, even if there are multiple values
  * If you specify a key=value then it will only remove keys that have that value
  * There is no coming back from this - so be careful (except for [hostinfo\_undolog](hostinfo_undolog.md))

E.g. to remove the osrev from a host
```
    % hostinfo_deletevalue osrev hawk
```

E.g to remove a single value from a list - this will remove a single instance of the value - if there are multiple values, you will need to run it multiple times.
```
    % hostinfo_deletevalue virtuals=webserver-z1 webserver
```
