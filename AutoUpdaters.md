Quite often there are going to be keys whose contents need to be updated automatically rather than by humans.

For example, if you have a key that contains the date that the server was last pinged.

The auto updater is a means of collecting all of these into a single place, so you can have a single cron job rather than many.

## auto\_updater.py ##
This script runs all of the scripts in the updaters directory. This directory can be specified in the settings.py file with the '''UPDATERS\_PATH''' variable.

These UpdaterScripts can be written in any language and all they need to do is output the changes in the following format:
```
hostname key=value[,value]
```

If the updater script doesn't return 0 then what it outputs will be ignored.

Options:
  * **-v** Verbose output
  * **-k** Kidding mode - Do everything but but don't actually make any changes
  * **--dir= < dirname >** Specify which directory to look for the updater scripts in
