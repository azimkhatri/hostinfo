# hostinfo\_mergehost #

Take the details of the two hosts and combine them into one
```
 % host_merge [opts] --src srchost --dst dsthost
   -k        Just kidding, don't do anything
   -v        Be verbose about what is happening
   -f        Force collisions to be resolved in the dst hosts favour
```

  * All srchost data will be copied to the dsthost, unless the dsthost already has that key set
  * The srchost will be deleted after the data has been copied across
  * This is used for when two hosts have been accidentally created with different names and then someone realises that they are actually the same host.
