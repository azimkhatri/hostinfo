# hostinfo\_replacevalue #

Replace an existing value with another in the hostinfo database

```
 % hostinfo_replacevalue [-k][--all] key=value newvalue [host...]
```

  * Replace any key that is set to the value with a newvalue
  * If you specify the _-k_ flag, it will tell you what it is going to do but not do it
  * This is generally for making a change like, for example, we are changing the name from 'v100's to 'sun\_v100's now - so `hostinfo_replacevalue --all hardware=v100 sun_v100` .
  * If no hosts are specified then all hosts will be affected but you have to specify the _--all_ flag to prevent accidents
  * You should try to avoid having spaces in values as the make using hostinfo from the command line more difficult.
  * Everything will get converted to lowercase.
